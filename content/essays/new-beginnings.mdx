description: "On finishing university, the novelty of freedom, and learning to say no"

This one's a bit overdue. I recently finished up with university—three years at the University of Cape Town that were, without exaggeration, probably the best three years of my life. I hope I'll be able to say the same about this next chapter.

I was quite sheltered growing up. Not in a bad way—I had good guard rails from my family and lived in what I'd describe as domestic harmony. But arriving in Cape Town, being on my own for the first time, was something magical.

I recall vividly walking through the streets, earbuds in, utterly mesmerized by the sun shining through canopies while listening to really obscure, novel music. It was my first time streaming music, and before the algorithm figured me out, I came across sounds my ears didn't recognize—almost like tasting a new flavor in a cuisine you've never encountered.

The theme of those years was novelty. First time cooking, getting drunk, falling in love, getting heartbroken, working... It felt like my latent energy could finally flourish, without bounds.

But as life goes, novelty wears off and the luster begins to fade. I got involved in several startups throughout my studies, employing the philosophy of saying yes to everything. This works pretty well when you have a voracious appetite for experience and growth. And so it did.

Eventually though, I learned the hard way that saying yes to everything is just another way of saying no to the things that actually matter. These days, I'm more selective about my yeses.
